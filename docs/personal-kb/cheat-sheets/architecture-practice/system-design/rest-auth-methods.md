# REST API Authentication methods

1. **Basic Authentication**:
    Involves sending a username and password with each request, but can be less secure without encryption.
    When to use:
    Suitable for simple applications where security and encryption aren’t the primary concern or when used over secured connections.

2. **Token Authentication**:
    Uses generated tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), exchanged between client and server, offering enhanced security without sending login credentials with each request.
    When to use:
    Ideal for more secure and scalable systems, especially when avoiding sending login credentials with each request is a priority.

3. **OAuth Authentication**:
    Enables third-party limited access to user resources without revealing credentials by issuing access tokens after user authentication.
    When to use:
    Ideal for scenarios requiring controlled access to user resources by third-party applications or services.

4. **API Key Authentication**:
    Assigns unique keys to users or applications, sent in headers or parameters; while simple, it might lack the security features of token-based or OAuth methods.
    When to use:
    Convenient for straightforward access control in less sensitive environments or for granting access to certain functionalities without the need for user-specific permissions.
