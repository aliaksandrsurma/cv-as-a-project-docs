Token Authentication: Uses generated tokens, like JSON Web Tokens (JWT), exchanged between client and server, offering enhanced security without sending login credentials with each request. When to use: Ideal for more secure and scalable systems, especially when avoiding sending login credentials with each request is a priority. OAuth Authentication: Enables third-party limited access to user resources without revealing credentials by issuing access tokens after user authentication. When to use: Ideal for scenarios requiring controlled access to user resources by third-party applications or services. API Key Authentication: Assigns unique keys to users or applications, sent in headers or parameters; while simple, it might lack the security features of token-based or OAuth methods.

We often describe the design target as “3 nines” or “4 nines”. “4 nines”, 99.99% uptime, means the service can only be down 8.64 seconds per day. To achieve high availability, we need to design redundancy in the system. There are several ways to do this: Hot-hot: two instances receive the same input and send the output to the downstream service. In case one side is down, the other side can immediately take over. Since both sides send output to the downstream, the downstream system needs to dedupe. Hot-warm: two instances receive the same input and only the hot side sends the output to the downstream service. In case the hot side is down, the warm side takes over and starts to send output to the downstream service. Single-leader cluster: one leader instance receives data from the upstream system and replicates to other replicas. Leaderless cluster: there is no leader in this type of cluster. Any write will get replicated to other instances. As long as the number of write instances plus the number of read instances are larger than the total number of instances, we should get valid data. High Throughput This means the service needs to handle a high number of requests given a period of time. Commonly used metrics are QPS (query per second) or TPS (transaction per second). To achieve high throughput, we often add caches to the architecture so that the request can return without hitting slower I/O devices like databases or disks. We can also increase the number of threads for computation-intensive tasks. However, adding too many threads can deteriorate the performance. We then need to identify the bottlenecks in the system and increase its throughput. Using asynchronous processing can often effectively isolate heavy-lifting components. High Scalability This means a system can quickly and easily extend to accommodate more volume (horizontal scalability) or more functionalities (vertical scalability). Normally we watch the response time to decide if we need to scale the system.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"CI CD Simplified","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/sdlc/ci-cd-simplified","content":"CI CD Simplified Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where code changes are frequently combined into a shared repository.

It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol. HTTP/3 HTTP/3 is the next major revision of the HTTP. It runs on QUIC, a new transport protocol designed for mobile-heavy internet usage. It relies on UDP instead of TCP, which enables faster web page responsiveness. VR applications demand more bandwidth to render intricate details of a virtual scene and will likely benefit from migrating to HTTP/3 powered by QUIC. HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) HTTPS extends HTTP and uses encryption for secure communications. WebSocket WebSocket is a protocol that provides full-duplex communications over TCP. Clients establish WebSockets to receive real-time updates from the back-end services. Unlike REST, which always “pulls” data, WebSocket enables data to be “pushed”. Applications, like online gaming, stock trading, and messaging apps leverage WebSocket for real-time communication. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) TCP is is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks. Many application-layer protocols build on top of TCP. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) UDP sends packets directly to a target computer, without establishing a connection first. UDP is commonly used in time-sensitive communications where occasionally dropping packets is better than waiting. Voice and video traffic are often sent using this protocol. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) SMTP is a standard protocol to transfer electronic mail from one user to another. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) FTP is used to transfer computer files between client and server. It has separate connections for the control channel and data channel.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"top-5-kafka-use-cases","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/tech/top-5-kafka-use-cases","content":"top-5-kafka-use-cases","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/architecture-practice/system-design/cache-use-cases-may-go-wrong","content":"Thunder herd problem This happens when a large number of keys in the cache expire at the same time. Then the query requests directly hit the database, which overloads the database. There are two ways to mitigate this issue: one is to avoid setting the same expiry time for the keys, adding a random number in the configuration; the other is to allow only the core business data to hit the database and prevent non-core data to access the database until the cache is back up. Cache penetration This happens when the key doesn’t exist in the cache or the database. The application cannot retrieve relevant data from the database to update the cache. This problem creates a lot of pressure on both the cache and the database. To solve this, there are two suggestions. One is to cache a null value for non-existent keys, avoiding hitting the database. The other is to use a bloom filter to check the key existence first, and if the key doesn’t exist, we can avoid hitting the database. Cache breakdown This is similar to the thunder herd problem. It happens when a hot key expires. A large number of requests hit the database. Since the hot keys take up 80% of the queries, we do not set an expiration time for them. Cache crash This happens when the cache is down and all the requests go to the database. There are two ways to solve this problem. One is to set up a circuit breaker, and when the cache is down, the application services cannot visit the cache or the database. The other is to set up a cluster for the cache to improve cache availability.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"key-http-methods","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/tech/key-http-methods","content":"key-http-methods","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"linux-file-system-structure","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/tech/linux-file-system-structure","content":"linux-file-system-structure","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/unstructured/symmetric-asymentric-encryption","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Fun","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/fun","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Memes​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Fun","url":"/docs/personal-kb/fun#memes","content":"                ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"tbd","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/quotes/tbd","content":"tbd","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Monitoring cheat sheet","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/personal-kb/cheat-sheets/deployment-and-infrastructure/monitoring-cheat-sheet","content":"Monitoring cheat sheet Data Collection: Gather information from diverse sources to enhance decision-making.Data Storage: Safely store and manage data for future analysis and reference.Data Analysis: Extract valuable insights from data to drive informed actions.Alerting: Receive real-time notifications about critical events or anomalies.Visualization: Present data in a visually comprehensible format for better understanding.Reporting and Compliance: Generate reports and ensure adherence to regulatory standards.Automation: Streamline processes and tasks through automated workflows.Integration: Seamlessly connect and exchange data between different systems or tools.Feedback Loops: Continuously refine strategies based on feedback and performance analysis.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create a Blog Post","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/tutorial/tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Create your first Post​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Create a Blog Post","url":"/docs/tutorial/tutorial-basics/create-a-blog-post#create-your-first-post","content":" Create a file at blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md:  blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md --- slug: greetings title: Greetings! authors: - name: Joel Marcey title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1 url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey image_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png - name: Sébastien Lorber title: Docusaurus maintainer url: https://sebastienlorber.com image_url: https://github.com/slorber.png tags: [greetings] --- Congratulations, you have made your first post!
